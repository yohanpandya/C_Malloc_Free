This C code implements a dynamic memory allocator for heap management, providing functions for allocating and freeing memory blocks. The core allocation function, balloc, employs a best-fit placement policy to efficiently find and allocate memory blocks based on size. Notably, it  handles both exact matches and cases where a larger free block needs to be split into an allocated block and a new free block. The split operation ensures optimal space utilization and aligns with the heap block requirements.
